PHP_CodeSniffer requires PHP version 5.1.2 or greater.

The SVN pre-commit hook requires PHP version 5.2.4 or greater due to its use of the vertical whitespace character.

**Note:** Individual sniffs may have additional requirements, such as external applications and scripts. See the Configuration Options page for a list of these requirements.
