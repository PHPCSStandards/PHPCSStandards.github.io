PHP_CodeSniffer requires PHP version 5.4.0 or greater, although individual sniffs may have additional requirements such as external applications and scripts. See the [[Configuration Options]] manual page for a list of these requirements.

Additionally, PHP_CodeSniffer requires the following PHP extensions to be enabled:
- Tokenizer: used by the core tokenizer to process PHP files
- SimpleXML: used to process ruleset XML files
- XMLWriter: used to create some report formats
