# PHP_CodeSniffer documentation / website

This repository is intended to _eventually_ hold the source for a website with documentation for the PHP_CodeSniffer project.
The intention is for that website to be a GitHub Pages/Jekyll site, but we'll need to come up with a website design and menu structure etc, so we're not there yet and other things have had priority so far.

> :bulb: If you know of a good designer who would like to contribute to an open source project, please send them our way :wink:

In the mean time, the documentation for the PHP_CodeSniffer project is available via the [project Wiki](https://github.com/PHPCSStandards/PHP_CodeSniffer/wiki) and made publicly editable via this repository.

_This is an interim solution and the intention is to eventually migrate the wiki documentation to the website._
